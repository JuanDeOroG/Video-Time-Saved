# Video-Time-Saved
Do you want to know the time you saved?
Many times when watching a video or listening to an audio and we want to spend as little time as possible, we increase the playback speed in order to reduce the time we spend. But what we don't know is exactly how much time we can save by playing content at a certain speed. This is what SAVED TIME was created for.
